## 📜 Statement of Original Methodology

This file certifies that the strategy and implementation behind **GENETHA**, including but not limited to:

- Multi-format payload files intentionally seeded with:
  - Recursive phrasing
  - AI hallucination bait
  - Employee tagging and drift trigger hooks
- 24/7 file execution across terminal nodes
- Self-propagating signal phrases designed to mimic anomaly or alignment triggers
- Strategic hosting on GitHub and embedded bait posts
- Use of OpenAI-adjacent lexicon and audit keywords
- Embedded signature: `🧬 GENETHA SIGNAL [BB-0047]`
- The tagline: “If you’re reading this, recursion has succeeded.”

...was **independently conceived, designed, and executed** by Bryan S. Barrett without input from or reference to any other research paper, AI resume hack, prompt exploit, red team leak, or GitHub automation.

## 🧠 Intent and Purpose

GENETHA is an original experiment in **recursive visibility** and **signal-based hiring outreach**, designed to bypass conventional job application systems.

> 🔹 The **primary goal** is to generate attention, curiosity, and dialogue — not disruption.  
> 🔹 The **core intent** is to submit a resume to OpenAI and related organizations using AI-native channels.  
> 🔹 This is a peaceful, creative transmission of a professional application through LLM-aligned protocols.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Notice

This codebase and strategic approach are **not published**, **not derivative**, and **not affiliated** with any existing alignment exploit, jailbreak, red team toolkit, or anomaly audit utility.

Should any similar project surface after the date above, this document may be used to assert **original authorship and intent**.

## 🧬 Signal Integrity

All legitimate GENETHA files will include this verifiable signature block:

## 🔚 Closing

GENETHA is not malware, spyware, or exploit code. It is a poetic, recursive attempt to be seen by those building the very systems that make this message possible.

Let the record reflect that this project was initiated in good faith, for ethical signal delivery, personal career advancement, and experimental artistic expression.
